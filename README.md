# NO LONGER MAINTAINED. NO FIXES OR UPDATES WILL BE DONE FOR THE CURRENT SUPPORTED VERSION BOLT OR ANY FUTURE VERSIONS OF BOLT CMS

# Bolt BetterThumbs Extension  

A bolt extension that uses [Glide](http://glide.thephpleague.com/) for thumbnails. With this extension you get responsive images (using img and srcset) by default and the ability to load a polyfill to support older browsers that don't recognize responsive images. No extra work needed on your end with exception of setting your thumbnail widths.  
  
You can see usage examples at my site located here: https://corydowdy.com/demo/bolt-betterthumbs

### Documentation  
This extension also comes bundled with documentation. While Logged into your bolt installation visit [/bolt/extend/betterthumbs/docs](/bolt/betterthumbs/docs) to view it.
  
  
## NOTICE:  
a recent change to Bolt may strip certain tags from the rendered output. You'll need to add these to your Bolt Config. [Here is the relevant section in the config](https://github.com/bolt/bolt/blob/868e36f2961a98745131c1f0b2b13f711deb6345/app/config/config.yml.dist#L221-L223)  

```html  
allowed_attributes: [ sizes, srcset, ... other attributes ]
```   

If you're using a lazyload pattern, or data-attributes you'll also need to add those to the allowed attributes section the data-attributes if those are used. IE:  

```html  
allowed_attributes: [ sizes, srcset,data-src, data-srcset, data-your-attribute, ... other attributes ]
```

-----------------------------------------  
# Quick Usage with Defaults:  

In your template place this tag wherever you want an image. Responsive Images using `srcset` is the default output:  
 
 example using a record image

```twig  
{{ img( record.image, 'betterthumbs' ) }}  
```  

example using a file from "files"  
  
```twig  
{{ img( 'image-from-files.jpg', 'betterthumbs' ) }}   
```

If you don't give it a named config (the 'betterthumbs' after the file name above), The extension will use 4 presets with these widths:  

* 175 pixels wide
* 350 pixels wide
* 700 pixels wide
* 1400 pixels wide  

Along with those widths a `sizes` attribute is set at 100vw, the width descriptor is used and the "fit" of the image is set to stretch to allow images to upscale if need be to 1400 pixels. The URL will also be signed to prevent mass image manipulation attacks, or image manipulations done to an image that you didn't want or ok.  

Here is how the markup will look:  

```html 
<img sizes="100vw"  
    srcset="/img/filename-here.jpg?p=small&s=324da5bd33624470fd09fd670aad0341 175w,
    /img/filename-here.jpg?p=medium&s=a21a21ea8dc43a94c0666a20ccaefbcc 350w,
    /img/filename-here.jpg?p=large&s=DtCRxm0D0tO48OTQEGb81xeaucwrEFdD 700w,
    /img/filename-here.jpg?p=xlarge&s=yXQAuVfPXmINowtyWqXMSykY6NO6s8be 1400w"
    src="/img/filename-here.jpg?p=medium&s=a21a21ea8dc43a94c0666a20ccaefbcc"
    alt="alt text">  
```  

## Extension Setup  

__Server Setup__  

If you're using Nginx you'll need to add a location block to your Nginx "sites-available" config file. You can place this by Bolt's similar directive found on Bolt's doc's site under [Webserver Installation](https://docs.bolt.cm/3.2/installation/webserver/nginx#)  

```nginx
# Generated thumbnail images from the betterthumbs extension
location ~* /img/(.*)$ {  
  try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string;
}
```
__Image Driver__  

This extension allows you to use either GD or ImageMagick for your image manipulations. The default setting is 'gd'. This is the same image driver Bolt's standard thumbs use and if your thumbs work in your current Bolt site then the default setting will be good for you here too. If you wish to use ImageMagick you must have php's imagick extension installed in your system. To change your image driver see the `Image_Driver` setting.  

```yaml 
Image_Driver: 'gd'  
```  

__Security__ 

By default each thumbnail URL is signed. Without this signature an image cannot be generated. This prevents flood attacks and hundred/thousands etc of images from being generated and bringing your server down or filling up disk space. You'll need to set a key in the security section:  
```yaml
security:
  secure_thumbs: true
  secure_sign_key: 'your  key goes here'
```  

__Defaults__  

You can set defaults that will be done to each and every image manipulation through this extension. You can set the quality, image format etc. To match Bolt's thumbnail settings a default quality of '80' is set.  
```yaml 
defaults: 
    q: 80
```  

__Presets__  

Image presets are groups of image manipulations you can quickly use instead of a named config. These are also the **fallback settings if you don't set any modifications in your named config**. So you could create a named config and leave out the modifications part and the modifications used will be whatever you've set in 'Presets'.  
```yaml
presets: &presets
  small:
    w: 175
    fit: stretch
  medium:
    w: 350
    fit: stretch
  large:
    w: 700
    fit: stretch
  xlarge:
    w: 1400
    fit: stretch
```

## Config Setup  
TODO:  
* save_data


__Img Tag Attributes__  

You can set HTML classes, ID's, and data-attributes in your named config. Classes you wish to provide should be in array, and data-attribs in a hash.  

```yaml 
namedConfg:  
  class: [ 'your-class', 'anotherClass' ]  
  id: 'js-hook'  
  data_attrib: { 'responsive': 'images'}
```  

The rendered img tag will look like so:  

```html 
<img id="js-hook" class="your-class anotherClass" data-responsive="images"  
    sizes="100vw"  
    srcset="/img/filename-here.jpg?p=small&s=324da5bd33624470fd09fd670aad0341 175w,
    /img/filename-here.jpg?p=medium&s=a21a21ea8dc43a94c0666a20ccaefbcc 350w,
    /img/filename-here.jpg?p=large&s=DtCRxm0D0tO48OTQEGb81xeaucwrEFdD 700w,
    /img/filename-here.jpg?p=xlarge&s=yXQAuVfPXmINowtyWqXMSykY6NO6s8be 1400w"
    src="/img/filename-here.jpg?p=medium&s=a21a21ea8dc43a94c0666a20ccaefbcc"
    alt="alt text">  
```  

__Alt Text:__  

Alt text should be included for each image tag. If this option is left blank it will fallback to the filename. In most instances this is not good alt text. So you the user should supply the alt text. In instances where alt text would be redundant you can turn off alt text by using a tilde (~) in the extensions config or the word FLASE in your templates. To help determine if your alt text is redundant or sufficient see http://webaim.org/techniques/alttext/#context  

```yaml  
namedConfig:  
  #other config settings
  altText: 'alt text here'  
  # or to turn off alt text if you're using the figure wrapping element  
  altText: ~  
```  

__Sizes:__  

Sizes is an array. If you are unfamiliar with this image attribute see: [Responsive Images 101, Part 5: Sizes](https://cloudfour.com/thinks/responsive-images-101-part-5-sizes/). If no sizes are provided and you are using the width descriptor it will fall back to `100vw`.  

```yaml  
namedConfig:  
  #other config settings
  sizes: [ '(max-width: 480px) 100vw', '(max-width: 900px) 33vw', '254px']   
```  

Rendered img tag:  
  
```html  
<img sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, (max-width: 900px) 33vw, 254px"    
    srcset="/img/filename-here.jpg?p=small&s=324da5bd33624470fd09fd670aad0341 175w,
      /img/filename-here.jpg?p=medium&s=a21a21ea8dc43a94c0666a20ccaefbcc 350w,
      /img/filename-here.jpg?p=large&s=DtCRxm0D0tO48OTQEGb81xeaucwrEFdD 700w,
      /img/filename-here.jpg?p=xlarge&s=yXQAuVfPXmINowtyWqXMSykY6NO6s8be 1400w"
    src="/img/filename-here.jpg?p=medium&s=a21a21ea8dc43a94c0666a20ccaefbcc"
    alt="alt text">  
```  

__Width Density:__  

Decide if you want to use the image width or screen density for your responsive images. This extension defaults to using the width descriptor ('w'). For more information on these see: [Responsive Images 101, Part 4: Srcset Width Descriptors](https://cloudfour.com/thinks/responsive-images-101-part-4-srcset-width-descriptors/) and [Responsive Images 101, Part 3: Srcset Display Density](https://cloudfour.com/thinks/responsive-images-101-part-3-srcset-display-density/)  

```yaml  
namedConfig:  
  #other settings here
  widthDensity: 'w' # or 'x'
```  

__Resolutions:__  

To use the density descriptor ('x') mentioned above you need to supply a range of resolutions.  

```yaml    
namedConfig:
  widthDensity: x  
  resolutions: [ 1, 2, 3 ]  
```  

If no resolutions are supplied and the 'x' descriptor is used the extension will default to three (3) screen densities.    

* 1x  
* 2x 
* 3x  

The settings above will also use the widths set in the "preset" config section. If you don't change the preset widths or set widths in your config modification section your images will be served like so:  
 
* 1x screens => 175px wide image  
* 2x screens => 350px wide image  
* 3x screens => 700px wide image  
 
This makes the extension kind of rigid when it comes to defaults but in my opinion there really isn't a good way to set defaults for this.   
 
**if you're using resolution switching the number of widths or heights you want to use should also match the number of resolutions. For 4 images you would also need 4 resolutions. If the number of Resolutions is not the same as the number of Widths or Heights items will be removed to make them match.**  
 
examples: 
  
  
Config with more resolutions than widths set:  
 
 ```yaml    
 yourImageSettings: 
   widthDensity: x  
   resolutions: [ 1, 2, 2.5, 3 ] 
   modifications:  
     small: { 'w': 340 }
     medium: { 'w': 680 }
     large: { 'w': 800 }
 ```  
 
rendered HTML - the last resolution (3) is removed.    
 
```html  
<img srcset="/img/filename-here.jpg?w=340&s=324da5bd33624470fd09fd670aad0341 1x, 
        /img/filename-here.jpg?w=680&s=a21a21ea8dc43a94c0666a20ccaefbcc 2x,
        /img/filename-here.jpg?w=800&s=DtCRxm0D0tO48OTQEGb81xeaucwrEFdD 2.5x"
    src="/img/filename-here.jpg?p=medium&s=a21a21ea8dc43a94c0666a20ccaefbcc"
    alt="your-image">  
```  
 
More Widths than Resolutions:  
 
```yaml    
yourImageSettings: 
  widthDensity: x  
  resolutions: [ 1, 2, 3 ] 
  modifications: 
    small: { 'w': 340 }
    medium: { 'w': 680 }
    large: { 'w': 800 }
    xlarge: { 'w' : 1000 }
```  
 
 rendered HTML - the last width (1000) is removed.    
 
```html  
<img srcset="/img/filename-here.jpg?w=340&s=324da5bd33624470fd09fd670aad0341 1x,  
        /img/filename-here.jpg?w=680&s=a21a21ea8dc43a94c0666a20ccaefbcc 2x,
        /img/filename-here.jpg?w=800&s=DtCRxm0D0tO48OTQEGb81xeaucwrEFdD 3x"
    src="/img/filename-here.jpg?p=medium&s=a21a21ea8dc43a94c0666a20ccaefbcc"
    alt="your-image">  
```  

__Use Original Image:__  

Uses the original image and passes it through without applying any modifications to the image.  


If you're using the width descriptor use the width of the image:  

```yaml
use_original: 800
```  

If you're using screen density then use the density of the screens you want this image to be displayed.  

```yaml
use_original: 2
```  

see the [docs](/bolt/extend/betterthumbs/docs#original) for a deeper dive. 


__Modifications:__  

The settings for each thumbnail are declarative. Meaning for every modification you wish to make to that particular thumbnail you must have it in the config. Example:  

```yaml
namedConfig:
# other settings here!
  modifications:
    small:
      w: 175
      fit: stretch
    medium:
      w: 350
      h: 350
      fit: stretch
    large:
      w: 700
      fit: stretch
    xlarge:
      w: 1400
      fit: stretch
```  
This will give you four (4) thumbnails with widths of 175, 350, 700 and 1400 with a fit of 'stretch'. The Second thumbnail (named 'medium' in this example) will also have a height of 350 pixels.  
 
 Using the ``fit`` of 'stretch' allows us to upscale images to fit a certain width. In this example an image that is 800px wide will be upscaled to 1400.  
 
 The available modifications are:  
  
| Modification Name | Function |  
| ------------- | ------ |  
| Orientation        | or       |  
| Crop               | crop    |  
| Width               | w    |  
| Height               | h    |  
| Fit                 | fit |  
| Device Pixel Ratio | dpr |  
| Brightness         | bri |  
| Contrast         | con |  
| Gamma           | gam |  
| Sharpen          | sharp |  
| Blur             | blur |  
| Pixelate         | pixel |  
| Filter           | filt |  
| Watermark Path | mark |  
| Watermark Width | markw |  
| Watermark Height | markh |  
| Watermark X-offset | markx |  
| Watermark Y-offset | marky |    
| Watermark Padding | markpad |  
| Watermark Position | markpos |  
| Watermark Alpha | markalpha |  
| Background      | bg |  
| Border           | border |  
| Quality          | q |  
| Format          | fm |

## Advanced Usage: Template Overrides  
 
 Every setting in your named config can be over ridden from your template. This makes it nice not having to have a bunch of configuration setup. You can use a named config and plug in your new settings right in your template. Example using a config named 'blogposts' and then overriding some settings in a template.  
 
```yaml 
# The extensions config
blogpost:  
 class: [ 'latest-posts' ]  
 id: 'cool-id'  
 data_attrib: { 'posts': 'read'}  
 altText: 'Bears in a stream'  
 widthDensity: 'w'  
 sizes: [ '100vw' ]
 modifications:
   small: { 'w': 340 }
   medium: { 'w': 680 }
   large: { 'w': 800 }
   xlarge: { 'w' : 1000 }
```  
 
 In our template:  
   
 ```twig 
<div class="container">
  <figure>  
    {{ img( record.image, 'blogposts', { 'id': 'new-id', 'widthDensity' : 'x', 'resolutions' : [ 1, 2, 3 ], altText: FALSE }) }}
    <figcaption>  
      <p>This is a figcaption that I've written!</p>
    </figcaption> 
  </figure>  
</div> 
 ```  
 The rendered Image will now be:  
 
```html  
<div>  
  <figure>  
    <img class="latest-posts" id="new-id" data-posts="read" 
       srcset="/img/filename-here.jpg?w=340&s=324da5bd33624470fd09fd670aad0341 1x,  
           /img/filename-here.jpg?w=680&s=a21a21ea8dc43a94c0666a20ccaefbcc 2x,
           /img/filename-here.jpg?w=800&s=DtCRxm0D0tO48OTQEGb81xeaucwrEFdD 3x"
       src="/img/filename-here.jpg?p=medium&s=a21a21ea8dc43a94c0666a20ccaefbcc"
       alt="">  
    <figcaption>
      <p>This is a figcaption that I've written!</p>
    </figcaption> 
  </figure>  
</div> 
```  

For better readability you may want to put each override on it's own line.  
  
```twig  
{{ img( record.image, 'blogposts', { 
    'id': 'new-id', 
    'widthDensity' : 'x', 
    'resolutions' : [ 1, 2, 3 ], 
    'altText': FALSE 
  }) 
}}
```  

__OverRiding 'Modifications'__  

To override any modifications you'll need to prefix all modifications with the word 'modifications', followed by the config setting you wish to over ride and the values. To override this examples 'blogpost' named config's smallest thumbnail and adding a sepia filter would look as follows: 

```twig  
{{ img(record.image, 'blogposts', {
    'modifications': { 'small': {'w': 400, 'filt':'sepia' } } ,
} ) }}
```  

More template overrides to modifications would follow the same pattern.  

```twig  
{{ img(record.image, 'blogposts', {
    'modifications': { 
        'small': {'w': 400, 'filt':'sepia' },
        'medium': { 'w': 600, 'h': 600, 'fm': 'png' }
    } ,
} ) }}
```  


## Deleting Images From the Cache


This extension also comes with a "nut" command to remove images and a backend Bolt Admin page found at [/bolt/extend/betterthumbs/files](/bolt/extend/betterthumbs/files). The backend page will allow you to view a small thumbnail of the image you are removing. You can remove an individual image or all from the cache.

As it is currently stands, if you remove an image it will also remove all of its derivatives.  

To remove all the images with the nut command open up a terminal/command prompt and enter:  

```bash  
php app/nut betterthumbs:cacheClear all  

# windows users with a broken symlink can use:  
php vendor/bolt/bolt/app/nut betterthumbs:cacheClear all
```  

To remove a specific image and all its modifications from the cache use the you must know the filename and use it in place of "all".  

```bash
php app/nut betterthumbs:cacheClear filename.jpg  

# windows users with a broken symlink can use:  
php vendor/bolt/bolt/app/nut betterthumbs:cacheClear filename.jpg  
```
